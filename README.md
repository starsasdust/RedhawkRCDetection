# RedhawkRCDetection
A small Python-based project for RC control with OpenCV and feature detection.

Files 1 and 2 are utilized to capture chessboard images for calibration data.
Files 3 to 5 are different versions of feature matching and distance measurement code

The prototype code file 7 has three design flaws:
1. Fixed turn angle
2. Brute Force matcher
3. Not handle the non-detected situation
